# Termux-Battery-Monitor
Termux Battery Monitor tracks the battery percentage of an Android device using Termux and sends the data to a Node.js server. The server processes and stores the battery info, offering API endpoints for real-time monitoring. Ideal for remote tracking, it can be expanded with a web dashboard, multi-device support, and ESP8266/ESP32 integration.
